This project explores the application of Machine Learning for stock price prediction, a challenging yet insightful endeavor due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties in financial markets. Using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for time series forecasting, we aim to predict stock returns with a focus on learning trends from historical data. This project is divided into two main parts:
1. Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Network
We will build and train an LSTM model to predict stock prices based on historical closing prices. The model leverages the sequential nature of stock data to capture patterns and make predictions.
2. Stock Analysis Dashboard with Plotly Dash
To make our predictions and analysis accessible, we will build an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. This dashboard will visualize stock data trends, provide insights, and display the LSTM model's predictions, enabling users to explore and analyze stock performance.

Results and Insights

The LSTM model can capture time-based dependencies in stock price data, allowing it to forecast trends and returns with reasonable accuracy. The dashboard provides a visual representation of the model's predictions against actual stock prices, helping users analyze past performance and predicted trends.

Future Work
Hyperparameter Optimization: Experimenting with different LSTM architectures, dropout rates, and learning rates.
Incorporating Additional Features: Adding more features like trading volume, moving averages, and market indicators.
Real-Time Data and Prediction: Integrate live data to enable real-time prediction and analysis.
