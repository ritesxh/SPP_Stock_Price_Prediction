Explanation of Requirements

    pandas: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.
    numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
    matplotlib: For data visualization (plotting the stock price history).
    scikit-learn: For data preprocessing (MinMaxScaler).
    tensorflow: Provides the backend for Keras (required for running deep learning models).
    keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
    plotly: For advanced visualization (needed when building the Plotly Dash dashboard).
    dash: For creating the interactive dashboard.


Installation Instructions
To install all dependencies, create a requirements.txt file with the contents above and run:
/* pip install -r requirements.txt */

This will install all the packages required for running the stock price prediction model and preparing the dashboard. Let me know if you'd like further customization!
